# ðŸ’³ Loan Default Risk Prediction with Business Cost Optimization

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Build a binary classification model to predict the likelihood of loan default and adjust the decision threshold to minimize overall business loss using a cost-sensitive evaluation approach.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**Home Credit Default Risk Dataset**  
- Source: Kaggle
- Main Features:
  - Demographics (age, gender, education)
  - Financial info (income, credit amount)
  - Loan status (target: 0 = no default, 1 = default)

---

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

### âœ… 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Imputed missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Normalized numeric features
- Handled class imbalance (optional: SMOTE or class weighting)

### âœ… 2. Model Training
- ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression (baseline)
- ðŸ”¹ CatBoostClassifier (high-performance gradient boosting)

### âœ… 3. Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Defined:
  - False Positive cost: $500 (good client rejected)
  - False Negative cost: $5000 (bad client accepted)
- Calculated business cost for various threshold values

### âœ… 4. Threshold Optimization
- Found threshold that **minimizes total business cost**
- Compared it to default (0.5) threshold performance

### âœ… 5. Feature Importance
- Visualized most predictive features using CatBoost
